# Makeover Studio
### Overview
This is what a MS Paint makeover would look like. You can apply eyeliner, lip liner, and lipstick in any color(s) you wish.
You can also save your creations as png or jpeg files. More features to come.
If you'd like to make yourself over, clone the repository and add a clear, front-facing photo to the `resources/models` folder.
Make sure your face is the only one in the photo.
